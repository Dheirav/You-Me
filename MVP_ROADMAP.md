# You&Me 💙
*A private digital space for couples to share moments, milestones, and memories.*

---

## 📖 Overview
You&Me is an Android app that creates a shared, secure space for couples.  
It allows two users to **link their accounts** with a unique code and unlock features like:

- 📍 **Location Sharing** – toggle on/off to share real-time location.
- 🖼️ **Photo Sharing + Widget** – upload pictures to a shared gallery with a widget that rotates partner photos.
- 🎉 **Milestone Tracker** – record and display relationship milestones (first linked, 100 days, custom events).
- 🔐 **Secure Couple Linking** – join using a unique 6-digit code, ensuring privacy.

This is the **MVP version** of You&Me, designed to be lightweight, private, and simple.
